# Game 1 - Untitled Game ðŸŽ®

**Final Points:** 100


## Description
We made a game.


Flag format: `KashiCTF{your_flag_here};`

## Link -
 [Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bf4WnxE81YIizN2e77x5PrkqGPwllgki/view?usp=drive_link) {Download the game from here} ==> `Challgame.exe`

## Writeup

On downloading the files, I ran the command 
```
grep -r "KashiCTF{"
```
Which showed that this string existed inside the binary `Challgame.exe`

so I ran 
```
grep -a "KashiCTF{" Challgame.exe
```

Which gave the flag.
