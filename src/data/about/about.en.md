Hey! I'm Jayesh Puri, an engineering student at IIT (BHU) Varanasi, graduating in 2028. I'm originally from Patiala, Punjab.

I'm super into techâ€”especially cybersecurity. I love taking part in Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions where I get to solve hacking challenges and keep improving my skills.

Coding is my thing. I enjoy building all sorts of projectsâ€”from security tools to AI experiments. I'm always curious, always learning, and constantly exploring new ideas.

Outside the tech world, I'm into music and anime. Music helps me stay in the zone while working or just relaxing, and anime is something I enjoy watching when I need a break.

I'm someone who loves trying new things, fixing stuff, and turning ideas into real thingsâ€”one line of code at a time.

## What I Work With

I enjoy working across different areas in techâ€”from writing low-level C code to playing around with AI models. Here are some things I use or explore:

- **Languages:** C, C++, Python, Bash, Java, Rust  
- **Tools & Environments:** Linux (Arch + Hyprland), Git, VS Code, Neovim, Pyrogram, FastAPI  
- **Interests:** Cybersecurity, AI, system-level programming, automation, scripting, and building things from scratch  
- **Other Stuff I Tinker With:** Web dev (HTML/CSS/JS), shell scripts, custom themes, fixing or modding hardware  
- **Current Focus:** Writing a basic programming language with a C transpiler, and building AI-integrated tools

## Fun Fact

- **Yes, I use Arch btw ðŸ˜Ž**

## Always Learning, Always Exploring

I'm constantly trying to expand my skills. Right now, I'm:

- Taking on CTFs to sharpen my hacking and reversing skills  
- Learning Rust to get deeper into systems programming  
- Experimenting with AI to see how it blends with security  
- Writing scripts to automate daily tasks or bigger workflows  
- Trying to understand how everything works under the hood
